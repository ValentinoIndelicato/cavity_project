    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a style or type of coding that utilizes classes, and instances of those classes, called objects. The majority of complex codes utilize this procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are a way to specialize and write customizable data-types. To each object, the class instructions assign both attributes and methods. Attributes are an object-specific variable, and methods are object-specific functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are a 1-dimensional object, which can have any number of components. In this example, we use the convention of the first component of a vector object being `x1`, which is assigned as an attribute; these attributes will continue up to the length of the initial list passed in (i.e. a list of length 4 will have attributes `x1` through `x4`, corresponding to each component of the list).\n",
    "\n",
    " - To add: the result of vector addition is itself a vector, whose components are the result of the addition of the corresponding components of the two vectors being added (i.e. $a_1 + b_1 = c_1$).\n",
    " - To subtract: the result of vector subtraction is itself a vector, whose components are the result of the subtraction of the corresponding components of the two vectors being subtracted (i.e. $a_1 - b_1 = c_1$).\n",
    " - To multiply: here we are only defining the dot/scalar product of two vectors. The cross/vector product will not be done in this code. The scalar product is the sum of the component multiplication (i.e. $c = a_1b_1+a_2b_2+...+a_nb_n$)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are coded below; however, it utilizes several methods that add functionality. It could be done without these methods, but the use of them is illustrative of more advanced techniques. The added methods are `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__` and `length`.\n",
    " - `__len__`: this utilizes the length property, which is a special method that is accessed like an attribute. The purpose of this method is to instruct python on how to calculate the length of the vector, which is obviously not natively done, because it has no idea what this data-type is!\n",
    " - `__getitem__`: this allows the use of subscripts (indices) in accessing components. It is the same as `getattr(vec,\"xn\")` where n is the index you wish to access. In fact, it calls this exact code and returns the corresponding component.\n",
    "  - `__setitem__`: this allows the use of subscripts (indices) in setting component values. It is the same as `setattr(vec,\"xn\", val)` where n is the index you wish to access and val is the value you wish to set the component to. In fact, it calls this exact code.\n",
    "  - `length` is a property method, which means it is accessed like an attribute, but runs some code (like `return self._length`)"

    "Matrices are a 2-dimensional objects, which can have any number of components. In this example, we use the convention of the first row and first column of a matrix object being `x11`, which is assigned as an attribute; the first index of the attribute will continue through the number of lists in the list argument passed in during initialization, and the second index will continue through the length of the sublist. All rows (sublists) must have the same length, and in fact the code makes sure of this by raising an error if the constraint is not satisfied. \n",

This can be trickier as it has a different constraint on the size of the factor matrices, and in fact, the factors (what you are multiplying together) can theoretically be vectors (which are just matrices with either 1 row or 1 column). The constraint is that the number of columns of the first matrix matches the number of rows of the second matrix, meaning the order is important! It is done by computing the scalar product between the $i$-th row of the first matrix with the $j$ column of the second matrix (i.e. $c_{1,1} = a_{1,1}b_{1,1}+a_{1,2}b_{2,1}+...+a_{1,n}b_{n,1}$). Matrix multiplication is done with the `@` command, which calls `__matmul__`.\n",
